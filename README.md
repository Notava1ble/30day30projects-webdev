Dynamic Routes: Createing a blog index + [postId].tsx page that reads local Markdown files.

I learned:
- How to use the `fs` module to read local files.
- How to use a markdown parser.
- How to use tailwindcss/typography

Should've done better:
- Get ViewTranstition to work.
- Implemented a searching functionallity.
